9/1/2025,"Brazil’s agriculture ministry confirmed a record 22.8 million tonnes of soybeans and corn scheduled for export between October and mid-November, driven by strong global demand and deteriorating U.S. crop conditions. More than 30 Panamax vessels have been nominated for loading across Santos, Paranagua, and Itaqui, with most fixtures targeting October 10–November 5 laycans. At Itaqui, 6–7 day delays caused by rain and equipment breakdowns are disrupting schedules. Congestion from overlapping grain and sugar flows has pushed vessel lineups beyond 110 bulkers. Trading houses are adjusting charter party clauses to allow sliding laycans deeper into November. Truck shortages in Mato Grosso are straining inland logistics, though government intervention has eased some highway blockages. São Paulo chartering desks report near-zero availability of prompt Panamax tonnage without premiums. Fuel costs in the South Atlantic remain stable, limiting owner pushback despite delays. Paper freight desks in Geneva and Singapore saw aggressive October buying, with Jan spreads widening by over $500. Traders warn that further slippage in soybean loadings could trigger renewed volatility and forward demand pull-in."
9/2/2025,"Typhoon Maemi made landfall south of Kaohsiung early Tuesday morning, bringing wind speeds of up to 160 km/h and forcing full shutdowns at five major Taiwanese ports. Vessel AIS tracking showed at least 14 bulk carriers rerouting away from the region, with anchorage zones around Taichung and Keelung cleared entirely. Storm surge flooding in southern China also caused berthing delays at Xiamen and Fuzhou, further compounding regional congestion. Traders report that multiple Japanese utility coal tenders expected for early October have been postponed as delivery windows tighten. Insurance premiums on vessels loading for the Far East have surged, particularly for forward Oct–Nov arrival cargoes. At least three Panamax cargoes carrying coal and grains originally bound for Kaohsiung are now redirecting to Manila or Singapore. Owners are reluctant to commit new tonnage to the region before weather clears, creating a short-term hole in FEAST supply. Singapore bunker values remain flat, but voyage durations are extending as ships avoid the storm track. One Pacific-based trading house reportedly advanced its forward hedging program to cover risk of extended weather disruptions. Port normalization is expected within 48–72 hours, but traders remain alert to follow-up storm development near Luzon."
9/3/2025,"A 72-hour strike at Colombia’s Puerto Bolivar coal terminal entered its third day on Wednesday, with union leaders demanding an inflation-linked wage adjustment and enhanced safety protocols. The shutdown has suspended all outbound coal shipments since Monday, affecting more than 3.5 million tonnes of contracted volume. Eight Panamax-class vessels were anchored outside the port as of this morning, with three others diverted to standby off Venezuela’s Puerto Cabello. Colombian transport officials have not issued any arbitration guidance, and the national port authority remains silent on a potential mediation timeline. European coal buyers in Germany and Poland began sourcing alternatives late Tuesday, triggering a flurry of U.S. Gulf and South African inquiries for October loadings. Heavy barge traffic along the Mississippi River was reported by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which confirmed several coal and grain stems had shifted to forward Panamax slots. Weather conditions in Cartagena and Barranquilla remain favorable, though terminals there have limited loading capacity and are not configured to handle Cape-to-Panamax rerouting efficiently. Some exporters have reportedly split Capesize bookings into Panamax parcels to avoid standby charges. U.S. Gulf terminals in Houston and Mobile are operating at full capacity, with laycan windows tightening into the third week of October. Multiple charterers reportedly booked mid-October Panamax stems on an optional basis, citing uncertainty over how long Colombian export disruptions would persist."

9/29/2025,"CFTC data released Thursday revealed a surprise reversal in speculative positioning, with Managed Money traders flipping from net short to net long in Panamax freight futures over the past five sessions. The shift added over 6,000 open interest contracts in Q4 tenors, marking the largest five-day increase since February. The move came despite neutral physical indicators, with no new port congestion, cargo disruptions, or regulatory shocks reported this week. Freight desks in Singapore and London said the sharp reversal was likely algorithm-driven, triggered by curve compression signals and technical chart breakouts. Brokers confirmed aggressive Oct and Nov buying in the early European session, pushing offers up by over $1,000 across major screens. Chartering activity out of Brazil and the U.S. Gulf was stable, with normal weather and no major scheduling delays reported. Argentina’s soybean export line-up remained flat, while Paranagua maintained normal loading pace throughout the week. The Korean Meteorological Agency upgraded a tropical depression in the South China Sea, but no port closures have been issued. Coal cargo flows from Richards Bay and Newcastle were consistent with the previous two weeks, showing no lift in spot demand. The Bank of Japan held interest rates steady on Friday but warned of increased FX volatility due to shifting U.S. monetary policy expectations."
9/30/2025,"Port authorities in Singapore, Rotterdam, and Busan confirmed full restoration of digital logistics systems over the weekend, marking the final stage of post-cyberattack recovery. Average vessel turnaround times have returned to pre-incident baselines at most major dry bulk terminals, with no additional backlogs reported. In Brazil, the Port of Paranagua reopened its dredged grain berth three days ahead of schedule, restoring full October capacity for soybean exports.Freight market analysts noted that tonnage availability for mid-October laycans remains limited due to front-loaded bookings made during the recent surge. Chinese customs cleared a backlog of 140 Panamax-class cargoes awaiting discharge across Qingdao, Dalian, and Tianjin — reducing expected congestion in early Q4. Dry bulk fuel spreads normalized across key bunkering hubs, with Fujairah and Gibraltar now trading near 30-day averages.Vietnam’s Ministry of Agriculture issued revised grain import forecasts, lowering Q4 demand due to domestic surplus, though no tenders have been canceled. In the U.S., Gulf Coast exporters continued to report stable loading volumes with no hurricane threats currently on the radar. India’s central bank issued a note warning of persistent inflation, but took no new action on interest rates during its monthly meeting. Freight contracts for October and November closed steady, with December seeing slight downward pressure as traders roll exposure forward into January."
